# Rentployment

## Description
Rentployment is a web application designed to simplify the hassle of job searching, and finding a new home nearby. Because this is an early concept and the team was limited to the amount of APIs that we can access, the jobs are limited to what is available via Github jobs and the housing listings are limited to homes available for rent via 9flats's API. 

## How it works
When on the home page, the user can search for a job title in a specified area. The website will then return the available job offers as well as housing available closest to the specified location. A map is also generated at the top of the page in order to give the user a better idea of the surrounding area.

## Technologies used
This website utilizes AJAX calls to grab data from APIs such as Github Jobs, 9Flats, Google Maps, and Leaflet. JQuery is also used to handle the on-click functions throughout the website and to handle the API calls and route the data to generate the results onto the various pages. Github Jobs allows our website to pull over 100 jobs from their API and return them to the user. 9Flats's API supplies our website with the housing options available. Leaflet's and Google Map's API allows the website to have a functional mini-map when the user receives the data they have requested.
